# Finch Running Guide

Welcome to the Finch Running Guide! This guide will walk you through the steps to run your Finch application. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, Finch offers a robust set of tools to simplify server-side web app development.

## app.dart
The main entry point for your Finch application is the `app.dart` file. This file contains the core logic and routing for your application. Below is a basic structure of what your `app.dart` file might look like:

```dart
import 'package:finch/finch.dart';

final configs = FinchConfigs(
  port: 8080,
  domain: 'example.com',
  dbConfig: FinchDBConfig(
    host: 'localhost',
    dbName: 'myapp',
    enable: true,
  ),
  enableLocalDebugger: true, // Only in development
);

void main() {
  var appServer = FinchApp(
    configs: configs
  );

  appServer.start();
  appServer.addRouting(getWebRoute);
}

Future<List<FinchRoute>> getWebRoute(Request rq) async {
  // Your routing logic here
  return [
    FinchRoute(
      path: '/',
      index: () async => rq.renderString(text: 'Hello World'),
    ),
  ];
}
```

### Note:
  Folowing the Finch example is the best way to understand how to use Finch. You can find the example in the [example](https://github.com/uproid/finch/tree/master/example) directory.
  we will add more examples with time.
  also you can check new ability of Finch in the demo page: [https://example.finchdart.com](https://example.finchdart.com) we keep it updated with the latest Finch version.
