# Email sending Guide

Welcome to the Finch Email sending Guide! This guide will walk you through the steps to send emails in your Finch application. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, Finch offers a robust set of tools to simplify server-side web app development.

## Send Email
The `MailSender` class is used to send emails in your Finch application. It contains all the necessary properties to send an email. Here is an example of how to use it:
```dart
import 'package:finch/src/mail/mail_sender.dart';

bool res = await MailSender.sendEmail(
  from: 'sender@example.com',
  fromName: 'Sender Name',
  host: 'smtp.example.com',
  port: 587,
  to: ['recipient@example.com'],
  subject: 'Test Email',
  html: '<h1>Hello, World!</h1>',
  text: 'Hello, World!',
  username: 'smtp-username',
  password: 'smtp-password',
  ssl: true,
  allowInsecure: false,
);
```
