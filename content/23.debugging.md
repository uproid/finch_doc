# Debugging Guide

Welcome to the Finch Debugging Guide! This guide will walk you through the steps to use debugging in your Finch application. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, Finch offers a robust set of tools to simplify server-side web app development.

Debugging in Finch is a powerful tool that allows you to debug your application in real-time. It provides a console widget that you can use to debug your application. in frontend side you can see a debugger bar in the bottom of the page. you can use this bar to debug your application. you can see the logs, errors, and other information in this bar. you can also use this bar to reload the page, restart the server, check the routes, and other useful features.

### Note:
the debugging is only available in local environment. it is not available in production environment. so you must set `config.isLocalDebug` to `true` in your `app.dart` file. also you must set `config.enableLocalDebugger` to `true` in your `app.dart` file. then you can use the debugging features.
