# Database Migration Guide

## Mysql & SQLite Migration

Finch provides a simple way to manage your database migrations. You can use the `migrate` (for mysql) or `migrate_sqlite` (for sqlite) command to manage your database migrations. This command provides the following options:

- `--init` or `-i`: Initializes the migration table and executes all pending migrations.
- `--create` or `-c`: Creates a new migration file template.
- `--name` or `-n`: Name of migration file while creating.
- `--rollback` or `-r`: Rolls back the most recent migrations.
- `--list` or `-l`: Lists all migration files and their status.

This commands are available after you run the app (or while running the app in console mode). you can use the `migrate` command in your `app.dart` file. for example:

```shell
dart run example/lib/app.dart migrate --init
```

## Add new migration file

You can add a new migration file by using the `--create` or `-c` option. for example:

```shell
Finch> migrate --create --name "add_users_table"
```

## Migration file template

Migration file template is a simple sql file that contains two sections:

```sql
-- [DATE & TIME]
-- [MySQL | SQLite] Migration File 
-- Name: [NAME OF MIGRATION] 
-- ## NEW VERSION:

   [HERE GOES THE NEW VERSION SQL CODE]

-- ## ROLL BACK:
  
   [HERE GOES THE ROLLBACK SQL CODE]


```
